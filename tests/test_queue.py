# Note: We'll need to update these tests once we see the actual
# structure of the generated queue.py file. The queue might be
# implemented as:
# 1. A class with methods
# 2. A function that returns a queue object
# 3. Multiple functions for queue operations
#
# For now, these are placeholder tests that show the expected behavior.
